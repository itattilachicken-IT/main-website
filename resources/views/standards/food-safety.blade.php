    <h1>Our Food Safety Standards</h1>

    <p>We know that food safety is a priority for our customers. Every egg and piece of poultry meat that leaves our farm is carefully monitored to ensure it meets the highest safety standards. Food safety starts on the farm and continues through every stage of processing and distribution.</p>

    <h2>Farm-to-Fork Safety</h2>
    <p>From hatcheries to processing units, we enforce strict hygiene and biosecurity protocols. Our farm is designed to minimize disease risk, and all staff are trained in safe handling practices. Equipment is sanitized regularly, and access to the farm is controlled to prevent contamination.</p>

    <h2>Hygienic Processing</h2>
    <p>During processing, we follow rigorous standards to prevent contamination. Slaughtering, cleaning, and packaging are done under strict supervision. Personal hygiene, sterilized tools, and proper storage practices ensure our products remain safe until they reach consumers.</p>

    <h2>Traceability</h2>
    <p>Every flock, feed batch, and processing date is recorded meticulously. This traceability ensures that, in the rare case of contamination, we can act swiftly to protect public health and maintain transparency.</p>

    <h2>Training Our Team</h2>
    <p>Our staff are educated about pathogen control, proper sanitation, and safe handling procedures. Continuous training ensures that everyone on the farm understands their role in keeping food safe.</p>

    <h2>Compliance and Audits</h2>
    <p>We comply with national and international regulations, including HACCP and ISO 22000. Regular audits confirm that our practices meet or exceed these standards, giving our customers confidence in our products.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Food safety isn’t optional—it’s a responsibility. By maintaining rigorous standards, we protect consumers, enhance our brand reputation, and contribute to a healthy food system.</p>
