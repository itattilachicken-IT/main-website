    <h1>Our Sustainability Standards</h1>

    <p>We are committed to farming responsibly. Sustainability guides our decisions to ensure that we protect the environment, conserve resources, and support local communities.</p>

    <h2>Waste Management</h2>
    <p>Manure, wastewater, and packaging materials are managed responsibly. Organic waste is recycled as fertilizer, reducing environmental impact and promoting circular farming practices.</p>

    <h2>Energy and Resource Efficiency</h2>
    <p>We optimize water and feed use, minimize energy consumption, and integrate renewable energy sources where possible. Efficient practices reduce costs and environmental footprint.</p>

    <h2>Biodiversity Protection</h2>
    <p>Our farm practices preserve surrounding ecosystems. Buffer zones, careful use of pesticides, and integrated pest management protect local flora and fauna.</p>

    <h2>Long-Term Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Sustainability ensures that we can continue producing high-quality poultry for future generations while protecting the planet. Responsible practices are embedded in every aspect of our operation.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Consumers increasingly value environmentally responsible products. By maintaining sustainability standards, we meet expectations, support communities, and safeguard natural resources.</p>
