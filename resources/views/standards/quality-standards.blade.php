    <h2>Health Monitoring</h2>
    <p>Our veterinary team conducts regular health checks and vaccinations. Healthy birds produce consistent, high-quality products that meet our strict standards.</p>

    <h2>Processing Standards</h2>
    <p>Our processing facilities follow stringent hygiene protocols. From slaughter to packaging, every stage is monitored to ensure quality, safety, and traceability.</p>

    <h2>Continuous Quality Improvement</h2>
    <p>We use audits, record-keeping, and performance metrics to continually improve quality. Feedback from customers and staff informs refinements to our standards.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>By upholding quality standards, we ensure consumer satisfaction, compliance with regulations, and a reputation for excellence. Quality is the essence of our farm.</p>
