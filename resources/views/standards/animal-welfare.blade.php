    <h1>Our Commitment to Animal Welfare</h1>

    <p>At our farm, the well-being of every bird matters. Animal welfare isn’t just a guideline—it’s our promise to every chicken in our care. From the moment they hatch to the day they are ready for market, we ensure that our birds live healthy, stress-free lives in environments designed for their needs.</p>

    <h2>Thoughtful Housing for Comfortable Living</h2>
    <p>We believe that happy birds are productive birds. That’s why our housing systems are designed to allow natural behaviors such as perching, scratching, and dust bathing. Our houses are spacious, well-ventilated, and equipped with clean bedding. We continuously monitor temperature, humidity, and lighting to mimic natural conditions, ensuring comfort in every season.</p>

    <h2>Nutrition and Clean Water</h2>
    <p>Proper nutrition is a cornerstone of animal welfare. We provide our birds with diets that are scientifically balanced for each stage of growth. Clean, fresh water is always available, ensuring they remain hydrated and healthy. By monitoring feed intake and nutrient quality, we prevent deficiencies and promote robust growth.</p>

    <h2>Gentle Handling Practices</h2>
    <p>Handling is done with care at every step. Our staff are trained to minimize stress during inspections, transport, and daily routines. We avoid overcrowding during movement and ensure that every interaction is calm and respectful. By treating our birds with kindness, we reduce injuries, stress, and the risk of illness.</p>

    <h2>Preventive Health Management</h2>
    <p>Our veterinary team ensures birds receive vaccinations on schedule and that biosecurity protocols are strictly enforced. Routine health checks allow early detection of disease, keeping our flocks healthy. A healthy bird is a productive bird, and maintaining welfare reduces reliance on medications.</p>

    <h2>Behavioral Enrichment</h2>
    <p>We provide opportunities for birds to engage in natural behaviors. Perches, dust baths, and foraging areas are part of every poultry house. Behavioral enrichment prevents boredom and aggression, promoting physical and mental well-being.</p>

    <h2>Continuous Monitoring</h2>
    <p>Animal welfare is never static. We regularly audit our farms, tracking indicators such as feather quality, activity levels, and mortality rates. These metrics allow us to improve continuously and uphold the highest welfare standards.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>We know that consumers care about ethical production. By ensuring animal welfare, we produce higher-quality eggs and meat while building trust with our customers. Our standards reflect a farm that cares not only about productivity but also about doing what’s right.</p>
