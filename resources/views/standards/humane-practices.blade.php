    <h1>Our Commitment to Humane Practices</h1>

    <p>We treat every bird on our farm with respect and dignity. Humane practices are embedded in everything we do, from daily care to eventual processing. Ethical treatment is not just about compliance—it is part of who we are.</p>

    <h2>Gentle Handling</h2>
    <p>Our team is trained to handle birds gently during inspections, transfers, and daily routines. Proper handling reduces stress, injuries, and mortality, ensuring our flocks remain healthy and productive.</p>

    <h2>Stress-Free Environment</h2>
    <p>We maintain comfortable temperatures, proper lighting, and appropriate stocking densities. These measures minimize stress and allow birds to engage in natural behaviors, promoting both welfare and growth.</p>

    <h2>Environmental Enrichment</h2>
    <p>Perches, dust baths, and space for foraging help birds express natural behaviors. Enrichment reduces aggression and boredom, creating a more harmonious flock environment.</p>

    <h2>Humane Culling</h2>
    <p>When culling is necessary, we follow veterinary-approved humane methods. Reducing unnecessary suffering is part of our ethical responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
    <p>We regularly review our practices, monitor welfare indicators, and update protocols. Humane practices are a dynamic commitment, always aiming for better outcomes for our birds.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Humane practices build trust with consumers and ensure ethical production. Birds raised with care are healthier, more productive, and better reflect our commitment to responsible farming.</p>
