    <h1>Our Nutrition Standards</h1>

    <p>Nutrition is the foundation of healthy poultry. We provide scientifically balanced diets that meet the specific needs of our birds at every stage of life.</p>

    <h2>Feed Formulation</h2>
    <p>We design feed to provide optimal protein, energy, vitamins, and minerals. Feed quality affects growth, egg production, immunity, and overall health.</p>

    <h2>Supplementation</h2>
    <p>Vitamins, minerals, and other supplements prevent deficiencies and support immune function. Supplements are carefully monitored to meet the nutritional requirements without overuse.</p>

    <h2>Monitoring Intake</h2>
    <p>We track feed consumption and adjust diets based on bird age, weight, and production stage. This ensures efficiency and reduces waste.</p>

    <h2>Water Quality</h2>
    <p>Clean water is essential for nutrient absorption and overall health. Water quality is monitored daily, and delivery systems are regularly sanitized.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Proper nutrition leads to healthier birds, better productivity, and higher-quality products. It reflects our commitment to excellence in poultry farming.</p>
