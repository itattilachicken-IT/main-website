                <p>
                    Thank you for shopping with Attila Chicken. We are committed to delivering fresh,
                    hygienic, and high-quality chicken products to your door. Our refund and returns
                    policy is designed to ensure food safety while maintaining fair treatment for our
                    customers.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">1. Perishable Product Policy</h4>
                <p>
                    Our products include fresh and frozen chicken items.
                    For health and safety reasons, we are unable to accept returns once an order has been
                    delivered and accepted by the customer.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">2. Order Verification at Delivery</h4>
                <p>
                    All deliveries are completed by our own riders. When your order arrives, please check
                    your items while the delivery rider is still present to confirm that:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The correct items were delivered</li>
                    <li>The quantities are correct</li>
                    <li>Packaging is sealed and undamaged</li>
                    <li>Products are fresh / properly chilled or frozen</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Once you confirm and accept the order, it is considered delivered in good condition.
                    If there is any issue, please notify the rider immediately or contact us while they are
                    still present so that we can assist you on the spot.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">3. When Refunds or Replacements Apply</h4>
                <p>You may be eligible for a refund or replacement if:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You received the wrong item</li>
                    <li>Items are missing</li>
                    <li>Products arrive damaged, spoiled, or unsafe for consumption</li>
                    <li>Your order was not delivered</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Claims must be reported within <strong>24 hours of delivery</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>Please provide:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your order number</li>
                    <li>A brief description of the issue</li>
                    <li>Clear photos of the product and packaging (if applicable)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We reserve the right to investigate before approving a refund or replacement.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">4. Non-Refundable Situations</h4>

                <p>Refunds or replacements will not apply where:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Issues are reported after the rider has left, unless related to product quality inside sealed packaging</li>
                    <li>Products spoil due to late collection or improper storage</li>
                    <li>Incorrect delivery details were supplied</li>
                    <li>The customer changes their mind after delivery</li>
                    <li>The product was handled or cooked incorrectly</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">5. Order Cancellations</h4>

                <p>
                    Because we prepare orders fresh and deliver using our own riders — and we do not operate live dispatch tracking —
                    orders may only be cancelled before preparation begins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once your order has been processed for preparation, cancellation is no longer possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you need to cancel, please contact us as soon as possible after placing your order so we can try our best to assist.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">6. Refund Method</h4>

                <p>If your request is approved:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Refunds will be issued to your original payment method, or</li>
                    <li>You may choose store credit or a replacement order</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Refund processing time is typically <strong>3–10 business days</strong>, depending on your bank or payment provider.
                    Delivery fees are refundable only when the issue is caused by us.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">7. Customer Storage Responsibility</h4>

                <p>To maintain freshness and safety:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Refrigerate or freeze your products immediately after delivery</li>
                    <li>Follow safe handling and cooking guidelines</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We cannot provide refunds for spoilage that occurs after successful delivery.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">8. Quality Commitment</h4>
