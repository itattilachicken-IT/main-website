    <h1>Our Feeding Practices</h1>

    <p>Nutrition is the backbone of poultry health and productivity. At our farm, we provide carefully formulated feed for every stage of growth, ensuring birds receive the nutrients they need for optimal performance. Proper feeding impacts growth rates, egg production, immunity, and overall flock well-being.</p>

    <h2>Balanced Diets</h2>
    <p>Our feed is scientifically formulated with the right balance of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Each growth stage—starter, grower, and finisher—receives a tailored diet to meet specific nutritional needs.</p>

    <h2>Feed Quality Control</h2>
    <p>All feed ingredients are tested for purity, nutritional content, and absence of contaminants. Regular quality checks ensure consistency and safety, supporting flock health and productivity.</p>

    <h2>Supplementation</h2>
    <p>Vitamins, minerals, and probiotics are added to prevent deficiencies and support immunity. Supplements are carefully monitored to avoid overuse and maintain health balance.</p>

    <h2>Feed Delivery and Monitoring</h2>
    <p>Feed is provided in clean, well-maintained feeders to prevent contamination and waste. Consumption is monitored daily to adjust portions as needed, ensuring efficiency and reducing costs.</p>

    <h2>Water Quality</h2>
    <p>Clean, fresh water is always available. Water quality is critical for digestion, nutrient absorption, and overall health. Drinking systems are regularly cleaned and maintained.</p>

    <h2>Why Proper Feeding Matters</h2>
    <p>Proper nutrition ensures birds grow healthy and strong, produce high-quality eggs and meat, and have robust immune systems. Our feeding standards reflect our commitment to excellence, animal welfare, and sustainable poultry farming.</p>
