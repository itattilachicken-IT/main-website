    <h1>Our Poultry Housing</h1>

    <p>Housing is critical to the welfare and productivity of our birds. At our farm, we design and maintain poultry houses that support natural behaviors, ensure comfort, and protect from environmental hazards. Proper housing contributes directly to the health, growth, and quality of our poultry products.</p>

    <h2>Space and Density</h2>
    <p>We provide ample space for birds to move freely, stretch their wings, and engage in natural behaviors. Overcrowding is avoided to minimize stress, aggression, and disease. Each housing unit is designed to accommodate the flock size comfortably, balancing productivity with welfare.</p>

    <h2>Ventilation and Air Quality</h2>
    <p>Clean air is essential for healthy lungs and respiratory systems. Our ventilation systems regulate airflow, temperature, and humidity. This prevents respiratory diseases, reduces ammonia buildup, and ensures birds remain active and healthy.</p>

    <h2>Lighting and Natural Behavior</h2>
    <p>We use lighting schedules that mimic natural daylight patterns to support feeding, breeding, and resting cycles. Perches, nesting boxes, and dust-bathing areas encourage natural behaviors, reducing stress and improving overall well-being.</p>

    <h2>Sanitation and Biosecurity</h2>
    <p>Houses are cleaned regularly, and bedding is replaced to maintain hygiene. Biosecurity protocols prevent introduction of pathogens. By controlling access, sanitizing equipment, and monitoring flock health, we reduce disease risk and promote sustainable production.</p>

    <h2>Monitoring and Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Regular inspections ensure housing structures remain safe and functional. Temperature, humidity, lighting, and equipment functionality are checked daily. Prompt maintenance ensures birds always have a comfortable and safe environment.</p>

    <h2>Why Our Housing Standards Matter</h2>
    <p>Healthy housing means healthy birds. Comfortable and well-maintained environments improve growth, productivity, and welfare. Our housing standards reflect our dedication to excellence, sustainability, and ethical farming practices.</p>
