    <h1>Our Processing & Packaging Standards</h1>

    <p>Processing and packaging are critical stages in delivering safe, high-quality poultry products. Our farm follows rigorous standards to ensure hygiene, traceability, and product integrity. Every step is monitored and documented to maintain consistency and safety.</p>

    <h2>Hygienic Processing</h2>
    <p>Facilities are cleaned and sanitized before each operation. Staff follow strict hygiene protocols, including protective clothing and hand sanitation. This reduces the risk of contamination and ensures safe products for consumers.</p>

    <h2>Quality Control</h2>
    <p>Products are inspected at every stage for size, weight, and overall quality. Defective or damaged items are removed. Continuous monitoring ensures only the best products reach customers.</p>

    <h2>Packaging</h2>
    <p>Poultry is packaged using materials that preserve freshness, prevent contamination, and provide convenience. Labels include batch numbers, dates, and traceability information, ensuring transparency and accountability.</p>

    <h2>Traceability</h2>
    <p>Every product is fully traceable from breeder to customer. Records include farm origin, processing date, and packaging information. Traceability supports food safety, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance.</p>

    <h2>Why Processing & Packaging Standards Matter</h2>
    <p>Proper processing and packaging protect consumers, enhance product quality, and build trust in our brand. Our commitment to hygiene, quality, and transparency reflects our farm’s dedication to excellence and ethical operations.</p>
