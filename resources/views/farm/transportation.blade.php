    <h1>Our Transportation Standards</h1>

    <p>Safe and humane transportation of poultry is crucial for welfare and product quality. At our farm, we implement strict standards to minimize stress, injury, and disease during transport. Every vehicle, route, and handling procedure is carefully planned.</p>

    <h2>Vehicle Design</h2>
    <p>Transport vehicles are ventilated, temperature-controlled, and equipped to prevent overcrowding. Birds have enough space to move and maintain comfort during transit.</p>

    <h2>Handling Practices</h2>
    <p>Staff are trained to handle birds gently when loading and unloading. Minimizing stress reduces mortality, improves health, and preserves meat and egg quality.</p>

    <h2>Biosecurity Measures</h2>
    <p>Vehicles are sanitized before and after transport to prevent disease spread. Routes are planned to avoid unnecessary delays, reducing stress on the birds.</p>

    <h2>Monitoring and Accountability</h2>
    <p>Transport records are maintained, including vehicle conditions, departure and arrival times, and flock numbers. Monitoring ensures compliance with welfare standards and traceability.</p>

    <h2>Why Transportation Standards Matter</h2>
    <p>Safe transport protects bird welfare, maintains product quality, and demonstrates our commitment to ethical practices. Proper transportation is an essential part of our farm’s operations and reputation.</p>
